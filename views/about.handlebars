        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            Mani Subramanian founded Fortisure Ventures LLC in San Francisco, California on January 5th, 2011. He runs
            this
            company along with his two co-founders and daughters Priyal and Meghna Subramanian. The name Fortisure
            represents
            our commitment to clients, employees and the community. Over the years they have participated in helping
            start-ups and
            supporting meaningful causes.

        <p>
            Fortisure consist of two words, "fortitude" and "assurance" these words encompass our values as a company.
            Fortitude
            is derived from the Latin word, "fortis", meaning strength, courage, and bravery in most challenging times.
            To
            facilitate this confidence, one needs the comfort of "assurance" and peace of mind looking toward the
            future.
            Fortisure was created based on these ideals and the notion that we would provide companies, partners and
            their
            employees with the strength, courage, bravery and the support they need for the future.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today, FortisureIT reflects that same commitment. This time, it is a commitment to our clients nationally,
            to our
            employees, and to the Akron-Canton community.

        <h2>Our Founder</h2>
        <p>
            With over 40 years of management experience in the global information technology industry, Mani started his
            entrepreneurial journey in 1993 when, as a new immigrant with a capital of $150,000, he founded IT
            Solutions.
            Subsequently re-branded as Caritor in 2003, the company grew to over 3500 employees over four continents
            with
            an
            annual revenue of $150 million in 2006. In 2007, with funding of $1 billion from Citibank, Mani engineered
            the
            buy-out of Keane, a Boston-based company over six times Caritor's size in terms of revenue. Mani presided as
            Executive Chairman of Keane until its acquisition by the Japanese conglomerate NTT Data on December 30,
            2010.
